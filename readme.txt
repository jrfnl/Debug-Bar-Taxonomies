== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can it be used on live site ? =
This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes, but shouldn't cause any issues if run on a production site.


= What are taxonomies ? =
>Basically, a taxonomy is a way to group things together. [...] In WordPress, a "taxonomy" is a grouping mechanism for some posts (or links or custom post types).
> The names for the different groupings in a taxonomy are called terms. [...] As an example from WordPress, a category or tag is a term.
>
>Since WordPress 2.3, you've been able to create your own custom taxonomies, but these have been a rarely used feature of WordPress until Version 2.9. In truth, they are an extremely powerful way to group various items in all sorts of ways.
